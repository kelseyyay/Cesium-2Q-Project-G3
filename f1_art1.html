                Max Verstappen delivered a dominant performance at the 2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix, taking victory in a night
                race that tested drivers and teams with a mix of high-speed straights, tight corners, and relentless street
                circuit demands. The win, confirmed after the post-race disqualification of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri
                for plank-wear infringements, marks Verstappen’s sixth triumph of the season and puts him firmly back in
                championship contention.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the lights out, the race unfolded at a blistering pace. Pole-sitter Lando Norris initially held
                position but ran wide at Turn 1, allowing Verstappen to immediately seize the lead. The Dutch driver then
                dictated the pace over 50 laps, balancing speed with tyre management on a circuit notorious for abrasive
                surfaces and rapid wear.

            <p>
                Pit stops were a decisive factor. Verstappen’s team executed a flawless two-stop strategy, switching from
                soft to medium compounds at laps 18 and 36, maintaining optimal tyre performance while avoiding traffic and
                minimizing time loss. In contrast, McLaren’s pit windows misfired slightly; Norris and Piastri re-entered in
                heavy traffic, which compromised their pace and contributed to their later disqualification. Mercedes’
                George Russell and Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc capitalized on these errors, advancing into podium contention
                as the race progressed.
            <p>
                By the final laps, Verstappen had built a comfortable lead of over 20 seconds. With McLaren’s
                disqualification, George Russell inherited second, while Kimi Antonelli rounded out the podium in third. The
                result underscores Red Bull’s combination of driver skill and race strategy, a
                blueprint for success on street circuits. As the 2025 season heads into its final races, Verstappen’s
                victory in Las Vegas not only consolidates his position in the championship but also demonstrates that
                dominance is earned through precision and tactical execution.
