                The squad of professional writers and editors, ready to seek out the truth beyond the excitement of
                every adventure of sports. From the skiing from the highest mountain to freediving into the ocean, we
                find no bound and limits to what stories we can tell. The news we hit is a run for your money. We are
                the Hit N Run. We hit you with the news. Run for the truth.

            <p>
                Hello! We are Hit N Run, a group of Grade 9 students who took the challenge of creating a sports website
                for our Computer Science class. We initially believed the project would be enjoyable, but it was more
                than that. It required far more effort and late-night teamwork than we expected. Despite hundreds of
                coding errors, unexpected layout issues, and constant reminders within the group chat, we gained a
                deeper understanding of the importance of teamwork and cooperation in producing a successful website.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Our motto, <span id="motto"><i>“We Hit You with the News. We Run with the Truth”</i></span> is exactly
                how we see this website. We
                want every article, every update, every highlight to be fast and honest, because if we’re going to share
                sports with you, we want you to feel it, not just read it. Hit N Run isn’t just a website, it’s us,
                figuring it all out as we go, making mistakes, laughing, celebrating the small wins, and sharing it all
                with you.
            </p>
